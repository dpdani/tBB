![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/dpdani/tBB.svg?branch=master)

# tBB
A network monitoring tool written in Python.

## Usage
This repo contains the tBB server which is what performs the monitoring.
Nevertheless, in order to actually see the results of monitoring, you want to connect to the running server.
To do so you'll need to install one of the tBB front-ends.
The only available front-end as of today is tBB_cli which uses command line for humain interface.
You can find further information [here](to-be-published).

## Project state
Currently, tBB is in an unstable state. Although no evident crashes or fatal bugs have been reported, please keep this in mind if you're planning on using it.
