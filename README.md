## Usage
This repo contains the tBB server which is what performs the monitoring.

In order to actually see the results of monitoring, you want to connect to the running server with a front-end.
The only available front-end as of today is [tBB_cli](https://github.com/dpdani/tBB_cli) which uses command line for human interface.
